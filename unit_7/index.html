					<h3>A Daily Practice&sol;Torture</h3>
					<h4>My Love&sol;Hate Relationship With Journaling</h4>
					<p>There are so many rules about writing. Write what you know, show don&apos;t tell, don't end a sentence with a preposition, and kill all adverbs come to mind. Aside from a universal hatred of adverbs, most writers will have a caveat for every rule. This is especially true for the dreaded &ldquo;write every day.&rdquo; Go ahead and Google &ldquo;write every day&rdquo; and see what comes up. Pretty much any span of time you can imagine. Or sometimes you'll get a target word count that will either make you shrug nonchalantly &lpar;kill it&rpar; or hide under the bed&hellip;</p>

						<h3>First Things First</h3>
							<h4>So many things, so little time</h4>
						<p>&ldquo;First things first.&rdquo; This is the mantra I whisper to myself &lpar;yes, out loud&rpar;. Except I also tack on&colon; &ldquo;Second things second, third things third&rdquo; as I start making a list I will ignore. It's a way to remind myself that there is a process for everything. And the first step in seeing order in the chaos is to identify what's most important. It helps to use a theory, that I stole from a &lpar;very quotable&rpar; person I worked for, called&colon; The Toddler Has to Pee&hellip;</p>

						<h3>Create vs. Consume</h3>
						<h4>Are kids wasting time or am I just old&quest;</h4>
						<p>I remember one day when I was a kid my friend came over to play. As I fired up my Atari 2600, I saw her face fall. With a sigh, she said her mom told her that, instead of playing hours of Missile Command and Space Invaders, we should do something more &rdquo;constructive.&ldquo; In my memory she made air quotes but I don't think they were invented yet. So when I tell my kids to get off the TicToc and the Roblox I'm conflicted. Some of these non&hyphen;constructive things are teaching them something &lpar;right&quest;&rpar;.</p>

						<h3>The Mom Phenomenon</h3>
						<h4>Finding things hiding in plain sight.</h4>
						<p>One of the most perfect scenes in modern cinema has to be in &ldquo;The Incredibles 2.&rdquo; Mom, who has just returned to her role as the superhero, Elastigirl, is trying to stop a runaway train when a call comes in on her Elasticycle. &ldquo;Mom, I can't find my high&hyphen;tops,&ldquo; says her son and, here's the best part, she tells him where to go look&excl; I have never been asked to save the world, but my family seems to believe I have a superpower, I have a psychic link with objects in my house and can locate them at will&hellip; </p>

				<h3>Hello. What's new&quest;</h3>
				<p>Who am I&quest; Glad you asked. Still working on it. All I can say is this&colon; If I'm on my Second Act, I hope life turns out to be a really long play.</p>
				<p>I was born in Long Island and live in Los Angeles, which means I have an opinion about everything and have a generally positive attitude when the sun is out. And when I'm not tired, stressed, or hungry &mdash; which is, incidentally, when my Long Island accent comes out in full force. Since this is a blog, the accent shouldn't bother&sol;amuse you.</p>
