		<h3>Write Every Day (groan)</h3>
			<aside>
				<p>My Love/Hate Relationship With Journaling</p>
			</aside>
		<p>There are so many rules about writing. Write what you know, show don’t tell, don’t end a sentence with a preposition, and kill all adverbs come to mind. Aside from a universal hatred of adverbs, most writers will have a caveat for every rule. This is especially true for the dreaded “write every day.” Go ahead and Google “write every day” and see what comes up. Pretty much any span of time you can imagine. Or sometimes you'll get a target word count that will either make you shrug nonchalantly (kill it) or hide under the bed...</p>

		<h4>First Things First</h4>
			<aside>
				<p>So many things, so little time.</p>
			</aside>
		<p>“First things first.” This is the mantra I whisper to myself (yes, out loud). Except I also tack on: “Second things second, third things third” as I start making a list I will probably ignore. I do this at work, I do this at home. I do this in the car when I’m stuck in traffic and my mind is racing. It’s a way to remind myself that there is a process for everything. And the first step in seeing order in the chaos is to identify what’s most important. It helps to use a theory that I stole from a (very quotable) person I worked for called: The Toddler Has to Pee… </p>

		<h4>Create vs. Consume</h4>
			<aside>
				<p>Are kids wasting time or am I just old?</p>
			</aside>
		<p>I remember one day when I was in elementary school, my friend came over to play. As I started to fire up my Atari 2600, I saw her face fall. With a sigh, she said her mom told her that, instead of playing hours of Missile Command and Space Invaders, we should do something more “constructive.” In my memory she made air quotes, but I don’t think they were invented yet. So when I tell my kids to get off the YouTube, the TicToc and the Roblox I’m conflicted. Some of these games like Roblox and Minecraft are teaching them something (right?). Does all our time have to be constructive, especially during a pandemic?</p>

		<h4>The Mom Phenomenon</h4>
			<aside>
				<p>Finding things hiding in plain sight.</p>
			</aside>
		<p>One of the most perfect scenes in modern cinema has to be in “The Incredibles 2.” Mom, who has just returned to her role as the superhero, Elastigirl, is trying to stop a runaway train when a call comes in on her Elasticycle. “Mom, I can’t find my high-tops,” says her son and, here’s the best part, she tells him where to go look! I have never been asked to save the world, nor do I own anything as cool as an Elasticycle, but my family seems to believe I have a superpower. I have a psychic link with objects in my house and can locate them at will… </p>

		<h4>What is the Meaning of Life?</h4>
			<aside>
				<p>Spoiler: I have no idea.</p>
			</aside>
		<p>I keep hearing about how the pandemic is teaching us a lesson about the important things in life. There are poignant Facebook videos, pithy memes, and stock-footage filled commercials telling us that giving up our frantic pace forced us to focus on what really matters. Finding time to reconnect with family and friends, taking care of our health, and learning to bake a lot of bread. Since my job is considered non-essential, (as I suspected) I’ve had a lot of time to think. I am, by nature, a ruminator so this is not necessarily a good thing. So when it comes to life  I think I have a handle on how, maybe even why. But the big WHY is where I get stuck...</p>
