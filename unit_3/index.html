				<h3>Write Every Day &#40;groan&#41;</h3>
				<h4>My Love&sol;Hate Relationship With Journaling</h4>
					<p>There are so many rules about writing&period; Write what you know&comma; show don’t tell&comma; don’t end a sentence with a preposition&comma; and kill all adverbs come to mind&period; Aside from a universal hatred of adverbs&comma; most writers will have a caveat for every rule&period; This is especially true for the dreaded &ldquo;write every day&period;&rdquo; Go ahead and Google &ldquo;write every day&rdquo; and see what comes up&period; Pretty much any span of time you can imagine&period; Or sometimes you'll get a target word count that will either make you shrug nonchalantly &lpar;kill it&rpar; or hide under the bed&hellip;</p>

				<h3>First Things First</h3>
				<h4>So many things, so little time</h4>
					<p>&ldquo;First things first&period;&rdquo; This is the mantra I whisper to myself &lpar;yes&comma; out loud&rpar;&period; Except I also tack on&colon; &ldquo;Second things second&comma; third things third&rdquo; as I start making a list I will probably ignore&period; I do this at work&comma; I do this at home&period; I do this in the car when I’m stuck in traffic and my mind is racing&period;It’s a way to remind myself that there is a process for everything&period; And the first step in seeing order in the chaos is to identify what’s most important&period; It helps to use a theory that I stole from a &lpar;very quotable&rpar; person I worked for called&colon; The Toddler Has to Pee&hellip;</p>

				<h3>Create vs&period; Consume</h3>
				<h4>Are kids wasting time or am I just old&quest;</h4>
					<p>I remember one day when I was in elementary school&comma; my friend came over to play&period; As I started to fire up my Atari 2600&comma; I saw her face fall&period; With a sigh&comma; she said her mom told her that&comma; instead of playing hours of Missile Command and Space Invaders&comma; we should do something more &rdquo;constructive&period;&ldquo; In my memory she made air quotes&comma; but I don’t think they were invented yet&period; So when I tell my kids to get off the YouTube&comma; the TicToc and the Roblox I’m conflicted&period; Some of these games like Roblox and Minecraft are teaching them something &lpar;right&quest;&rpar;&period; Does all our time have to be constructive&comma; especially during a pandemic&quest;</p>

				<h3>The Mom Phenomenon</h3>
				<h4>Finding things hiding in plain sight.</h4>
					<p>One of the most perfect scenes in modern cinema has to be in &ldquo;The Incredibles 2&period;&rdquo; Mom&comma; who has just returned to her role as the superhero&comma; Elastigirl&comma; is trying to stop a runaway train when a call comes in on her Elasticycle&period; &ldquo;Mom&comma; I can’t find my high&ndash;tops&comma;&ldquo; says her son and&comma; here’s the best part&comma; she tells him where to go look&excl; I have never been asked to save the world&comma; nor do I own anything as cool as an Elasticycle&comma; but my family seems to believe I have a superpower&comma; I have a psychic link with objects in my house and can locate them at will&hellip; </p>

				<h3>What is the Meaning of Life&quest;</h3>
				<h4>Spoiler&colon; I have no idea&period;</h4>
					<p>I keep hearing about how the pandemic is teaching us a lesson about the important things in life&period; There are poignant Facebook videos&comma; pithy memes&comma; and stock&ndash;footage filled commercials telling us that giving up our frantic pace forced us to focus on what really matters&period; Finding time to reconnect with family and friends&comma; taking care of our health&comma; and learning to bake a lot of bread&period; Since my job is considered non&ndash;essential&comma; &lpar;as I suspected&rpar; I’ve had a lot of time to think&period; I am&comma; by nature&comma; a ruminator so this is not necessarily a good thing&period; So when it comes to life  I think I have a handle on how&comma; maybe even why&period; But the big WHY is where I get stuck&hellip;</p>
